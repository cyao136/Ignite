					Hello! I'm Chengyu, a <b>passionate</b> gamer and founder of Ignite.
					<br>
					<br>
					I love indie games. I love playing them (FTL and Isaac are some of my favorite games), I love watching others play them, and I love coming up with new indie game ideas with my friends.
					 Although nowadays, I mostly play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Still have yet to play Undertale... Will definitely do when I get the time!
					<br>
					<br>
					In terms of experiences, I have worked at Alcatel-Lucent, Microsoft Studio, and Tesla Motors. After working for these big companies, I realized that
					 my true passion is still with video games, and I intend to make the industry better for all of us.
					<br>
					<br>
					Let's <span style="color:orange">ignite</span> some projects!

					Hey guys, I'm Michael, co-founder of Ignite. <br><br>
					I've known Chengyu for a big chunk of my life. As avid developers and gamers, we're motivated to make indie games a big part of the gaming industry.
					After working with some great people in developing apps and mobile games, I decided that this is what I loved to do in life. I hope Ignite can be the stepping stone 
					that developers and players alike have been looking for.<br><br>
					Can't wait to get this thing started!
